    "We obtained demographic, socioeconomic and comorbidity data from a COVID-19 GitHub repository that drew from the US Department of Agriculture, Area Health Resources Files, County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Kaiser News Health [24]. We obtained COVID-19 county cases and deaths from 1/22/20–12/21/20 from USA Facts [25] and additional demographic data from the US Census Bureau [26]. USA Facts is a non-profit organization providing data about government tax revenues, expenditures, and outcomes [25]. Area Health Resources Files is a part of the federal government’s Health Resources & Services administrations that includes data on population characteristics, economics, hospital utilization, and more [27]. County Health Rankings & Roadmaps is a collaboration between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin that provides local community health data [28]. All data used in analyses are publicly available and can be found on our lab GitHub page (https://github.com/lin-lab/COVID-Health-Disparities).\n",

    "County-level cumulative and weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths as of 12/21/20 were directly obtained from USA Facts [29]. USA Facts aggregates data from the Centers of Disease Control and state and local public health agencies. County-level data were confirmed by referencing state and local agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic variables were obtained from the US Census Bureau and US Department of Agriculture and included county percentage ages 20–29 years, percentage ages 60+ years, percentage male, and metro/nonmetro status classification. US Department of Agriculture rural-urban continuum codes were grouped into three categories for the metro/nonmetro categorical variable: metro, population ≥ 1 million (code 1); metro or near metro, population 20,000 to 1 million (codes 2–4); nonmetro, population < 20,000 (codes 5–9) [30].\n",
    "\n",
    "`County-level population distribution by race/ethnicity, including Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Native Alaskan, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander proportions, were directly obtained from 2019 US Census Bureau estimates [26]. County residential racial segregation indices of dissimilarity were obtained from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps [31]. These indices were originally calculated from data from US Census tracts from the American Community Survey 2014–2018. Counties with less than 100 Black/non-white residents had the index of dissimilarity set to be equal to 1.`\n",
